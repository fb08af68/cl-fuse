FUSE (Filesystem in user space) - http://fuse.sf.net - allows
to write filesystem code in userspace. This package provides 
bindings for libfuse, userspace library implementing the fuse
protocol.

fuse-test.lisp is a minimal usage example. It mounts an FS at
/tmp/test. It contains many-files (a directory with many 
symlinks named by consequtive numbers), same-name (no entries
in ls; you can cat a file -it will contain its name) and
symlinks (no entries in ls - every name exists as a symlink
to the same name under /).
